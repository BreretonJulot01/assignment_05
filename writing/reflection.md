### Due
By Friday's class: 15th October 2021

Please add your work here and remove the `todo` tag below when you start working. Please remember that this is an essay and that your written work is to take a narrative voice to discuss your thoughts that are inspired by the cues on each line of the outline.

I Robot, Her, and Robocop are all dystopias that show what a robot takeover would look like. Even with Hollywood showing the possible consequences that could happen in the future, we still have the possibility of Tesla Bots that will be, “more of a servant than a superhero, meant to do your shopping, clean your house and even tackle physical chores you might not want to do”(Hodgkins 4). While the Tesla Bot would make life easier for many people, the $10,000 price tag will essentially make low income families have limited to no access to the Bot. Humans strive off interactions with one another, cell phones already cost in person verbal and physical interactions. Robots would further minimize the relationships and connections between people, eliminating many people's reason for interaction especially after a time in which they had already been isolated. In addition, the Tesla Bot would make a reason for an average person to not have to do any physical activity if they could get a robot to do it for them and not leave their home. This would cause an increase in obesity rates around the world making the movie Wall-E seem realistic in its depiction of Humans in the future. These Tesla bots and future robots in general do have their benefits but as much as there are benefits there are also negatives to them.
Robots can help eradicate the needs for employers being understaffed and create stability in the workplace for many organizations. Robots could possibly work undesired jobs such as Package Loaders, Garbage Men, and Cashiers this would be helpful for the employers but not low income families. Low income families would not be able to easily obtain jobs that are commonly available for many people in situations of inconsistency in finding a stable job. This would cause for the poverty rates to increase drastically with people who were already poor and most likely not having the credentials to obtain jobs that hold high income.
