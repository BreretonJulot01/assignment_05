Please add your work here and remove the `todo` tag below when you start working. Please remember that this is an essay and that your written work is to take a narrative voice to discuss your thoughts that are inspired by the cues on each line of the outline.

Technology can be used for good and for bad. Technology in general in today’s society can do harm in many aspects in many different ways. In this paper, I will be focusing on one specific technology which is drones. The most common way that drones are used is to capture photos of things. For example, if someone wants to take a wider view picture of a big area, they will send a drone in the air and the drone will capture the full area. This would be most useful at big sporting events or to capture big areas of land on camera. Drones could also be used for surveillance which leads me right into why drones could be used in a negative way. Although surveillance through drones could be a good way to use drones, it also creates a problem. By watching people through drones, you are also invading their privacy. Privacy can be invaded this way by the government or it could be your peers around you using drones to survey over you and watch you.
	In the beginning, drones were thought to be something that could be helpful and a way to make jobs easier for us to do. Drones should be used to make surveillance easier. They should be used to make taking photos and film making easier. They should be used in science to help explore new areas of the world and in outer space. They should be used to transport important things like medicine, packages, and food. Drones were made and created to help us in these ways. They were created to help us live an easier life and to make tasks easier for us. Instead, drones have been used for other purposes which are hurtful to society and could possibly hurt other people. These drones have been used to watch other people without their permission and also deliver things in and out of the country that shouldn’t be delivered. For example, people that are in prison have people fly drones from outside and deliver something to them on the inside. Drones should not be used in these ways but they are which makes drones carry negative connotations with them. Drones could also be used to spy on people without them knowing. Drones could be flown anywhere and they can also be bought by any person that has the money to buy one. Drones can be as cheap as $150 so most people can afford a drone. When someone flies a drone over somebody else property or around someone this causes problems. People do not want someone that they do not know watching them or looking over their property all of the time. I know this happens to people because it has happened to me before. Someone that I do not know has flown a drone over my property and was recording me with their camera. This could happen to anyone because you have no control over who is flying the drone. 
	Drones were supposed to be helpful in ways that I have stated above, and they still are helpful in those ways but they are also being used to create problems. These problems will happen and continue to happen unless we figure out how to put an end to it. Right now there are no restrictions on buying drones and setting up drones to fly wherever you want. These problems could be solved by limiting the amount of drones that are being sold and limiting the amount of people who can get their hands on drones. This would help because if they weren’t sold as much then not as many people would have them, and certain people would not have them. You could also make them less affordable for the average person. At the end of the day, drones are used to help people but they are also being used in ways that were not intended for.
